# Diabetes Prediction

This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting diabetes

We're going to take the following approach:

1. Features
2. Evaluation
3. Data Visualization
4. Modelling


## Features
 
Below are columns in dataset

Number of times pregnant

Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

Diabetes pedigree function

Age (years)

Class variable (0 or 1)

## Evaluation

The Accuracy of the test data predictions.

Accuracy= No of Correct Predictions/Total No of Predictions
